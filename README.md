The app is about selling dishes as a resturant and having a dashboard admin so that the orders gets redirected to the owner so that the owner knows where to deliever the food. The food gets ordered and added to the food cart and can later be bought using paypal or stripe. Then the purhase gets saved in the database using prisma mysql however the stripe requires web hook for it to save in the database after purhase. The app also uses gsap for animation managment. You can send a gmail form if you have a question. There is also common information like about us and menu.
